#Simple rules to follow

##Try to not change code style (formatting)
I know that everyone has their own code style. You can of course
use your code formatting, if it helps you to read the code, but please,
don't re-format the whole code according to your formatting. It makes
trouble for everyone.

##Don't grief the repository.
We don't want griefers. Who wants? Contribute
only if you know that you have some meaningful
shiny idea in your imagination, that you wish
to share with everyone for a good purpose.

###That's all!
